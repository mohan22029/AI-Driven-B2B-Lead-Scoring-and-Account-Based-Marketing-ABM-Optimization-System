How to Create a Non-Ugly Figure

Definitions
Ugly: A figure classified as "ugly" typically suffers from aesthetic issues, yet it remains clear and informative. Problems may involve suboptimal color selections, cluttered labels, or unattractive layouts.

Bad: Figures deemed "bad" encounter perceptual challenges. They can be confusing, overly intricate, misleading, or fail in effectively conveying the data's message.

Wrong: A "wrong" figure is characterized by mathematical inaccuracies, misrepresenting data in a manner that is factually incorrect or deceiving.

Problems:

The color choice is harsh on the eyes.
The use of markers is excessive and distracts from the overall trend.
The aspect ratio doesnâ€™t complement the data representation well.

Correcting the "Ugly"
In line with the provided feedback to use the fig and ax methods

 Identifying and Resolving Perceptual Issues
Illustration of a Less Effective Visualization
Consider this example code which plots sine and cosine functions but falls short in terms of clarity
Issues: - The overlapping lines make it difficult to differentiate between the sine and cosine functions. - The absence of axis labels and a grid leaves the viewer lacking contextual understanding.

How to Improve
To address these issues and enhance the visualization

Correcting Mathematical Inaccuracies
Example of an Inaccurate Figure
Problematic Visualization Example:
To illustrate the issue of a mathematical inaccuracy in data visualization
ssue Identified: - This plot incorrectly suggests a linear relationship rather than the intended non-linear (e.g., sine wave) relation, leading to misinterpretation.

Correcting the Inaccuracy
To address the problem and accurately represent a non-linear relationship such as a sine wave, the corrected code below effectively demonstrates the accurate mathematical relationship
