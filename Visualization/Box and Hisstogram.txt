Combining Box plot and Histogram: Student performance analysis

Plot a histogram using the writing scores data.

Plot a histogram using the writing scores data. Set the number of bins to 30 and adjust the transparency with the alpha parameter as 0.6. The color should be green, and the density parameter should be true.

Additional Challenges
Try changing the number of bins in the histogram and observe how the plot changes.
Experiment with different values of alpha to see how transparency affects the appearance of the plot.
Try to interpret the distribution. Is it normal, skewed, or irregular

Creating a Horizontal Box Plot with Matplotlib

Create a horizontal box plot to visualize the distribution of a dataset representing reading scores.

Use Matplotlib to create a box plot representing the reading scores. Make sure the plot is oriented horizontally.

Compare the Distribution of Reading and Writing Scores Using Side-by-Side Box Plots

Compare the distribution of reading and writing scores within a dataset. Your task is to create side-by-side box plots for these scores, using a provided template as a guide.

First, you'll need to define a new variable called scores_data, which will consist of the reading and writing scores from your dataset. Then, follow the steps outlined in the template to create your box plots.

Comparing Reading Scores by Test Preparation Course Using Matplotlib

Compare the reading scores of students based on whether they completed a test preparation course. This analysis will help in understanding the impact of test preparation on students' reading performance.

Comparing Math, Reading, and Writing Scores in a Single Graph

Visualize and compare the distributions of math, reading, and writing scores in a single graph. You will achieve this by plotting all three sets of scores side-by-side for an easy comparison.

Please follow the steps provided in the template below to complete this activity. Remember, the key requirement is to retain the default settings for figure size, color, labels, and title in your graph.

Instructions:

Prepare Your Data:

Extract the math, reading, and writing scores from your dataset.

Store these scores in a list or an array for plotting.

Create a Combined Box Plot:

Use the prepared data to plot a combined box plot that displays all three sets of scores side-by-side.

Follow the provided template closely.
