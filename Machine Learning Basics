5.You are a healthcare researcher aiming to identify potential subgroups of patients based on their medical records to personalize treatment plans. How could unsupervised learning be utilized to uncover distinct patient clusters with similar medical profiles, allowing for more targeted and effective healthcare interventions?
A:Unsupervised learning can segment patients into clusters based on their medical records, revealing distinct subgroups without using any predefined labels.
6.You are an e-commerce manager and want to predict whether customers are likely to make a purchase during their website visit. How can supervised learning be applied to develop a predictive model that helps classify customers into 'potential buyers' and 'non-buyers' based on historical data and labeled purchase information?
A:Supervised learning can be employed to classify customers into groups based on their purchase history and other features, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
7.True or False:Incorporating irrelevant features in a machine learning model can improve its predictive performance
A:False
8.True or False: Feature selection in machine learning helps in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.
A:True
9.You are tasked with developing a spam email filter using machine learning. The dataset you have contains email samples labeled as "spam" or "not spam." Which features would you consider important for this classification task?

A. Sender's Email Address B. Word Frequency in the Email C. Font Style and Size D. Number of Links in the Email E. Email Attachment Size
A:A, D, E
10.You are working on a machine learning project to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. The dataset you have includes customer information such as age, usage patterns, subscription type, and a unique customer ID for each record.
Why would using the customer ID as a feature for predicting churn be ineffective?
A:The customer ID is not related to the underlying reasons for churn and including it may introduce noise into the predictive model.
